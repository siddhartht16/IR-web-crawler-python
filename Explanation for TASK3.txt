Process for merging the results of TASK1 and TASK3:

In both tasks, the urls were crawled by keeping in consideration, that the urls in shallower depth are more important
than the ones in deeper depth. Therefore the lists contain the urls by the level they were crawled instead of their depths.

Therefore while merging the two lists, emphasis will be on retaining maximum urls of shallower depths from either lists.

This algorithm should result into a merged list with minimal loss of information and also retain the order they were crawled

Algo:
	
	Let,
		A = List from TASK1 
		B = List from TASK2
		MergedList = Empty list
	
	if either list is empty, return the other list
	
	Get the length of both the lists
	
	Iterate till the shorter list among the two lists is not empty
		
		Pop the first item from A and the first item from B
		
		if both the items are same, add any item to the MergedList 
		
		else 
		
			Check if first item from A occurs in B
				If it occurs, 
					then add the first item from A to the MergedList and remove it from B
			
			Else check if first item from B occurs in A
				If it occurs, 
					add the first item from A to the MergedList 
					add the item from B to the MergedList
					remove the item matching to the item from list B from list A
			
			Else if item from A is not present in B and item from B is not present in A,
				Add the item from A to the MergedList
				Add the item from B to the MergedList
	

	After completion of the iteration, add the remaining items from the longer list to the MergedList
