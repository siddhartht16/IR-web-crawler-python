In task2, we have performed focused crawling for the keyword "solar" using the seed url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy".

Following two approaches were used:
Breadth first crawling
Depth first crawling

Breadth First crawling:
Crawler crawls the pages by level, i.e the neighbours are given more priority as compared to children. 
For example, crawler first crawls the seed url. Thereafter, all the children of the seed url are crawled, instead of going into the hierarchy of the first child. 
This process is then repeated for the children of each child of seed url and so forth.
In this approach, level or sibling based crawling is done instead of depth wise crawling for children.

Depth First crawling:
Crawler crawls the pages by hierarchy, i.e. the children of each node are crawled till all the children are covered.
For example, crawler first crawls the seed url. Thereafter it crawls the first child of the seed url. 
After that the first child of seed url's first child is crawled. 

This process is repeated till the complete hierarchy of each child of seed url is completed.
In this approach, depth based crawling is done instead of level wise crawling for children.

No. of urls found after focused crawling for Breadth first crawling: 536
No. of urls found after focused crawling for Depth first crawling: 301

Breadth first crawling has resulted into more no. of crawled urls.

Top 5 Urls for Breadth first crawling:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_photovoltaics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power

Top 5 Urls for Depth first crawling:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun

By analysing the results of both approaches, we can see that the top three urls are common. Rest are different.
